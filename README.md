# Waterfox for Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
This repository aims to provide prebuild deb packages for installation on debian-based systems. It includes an unmodified version of waterfox and will provide new deb files for different architectures on demand (open an **issue** and describe which arch you want and why).

I'm too lazy to make a proper launchpad repo so i'm uploading my deb files here, have fun and happy installing.
(Don't worry, a PPA will come as soon as I have the time to tinker with launchpad.)
